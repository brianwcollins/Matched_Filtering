# Matched_Filtering



This code uses GNURadio to apply matched filtering to different types of pulse signals. The following types of signals are included within the code

1. Cosine Wave

The width of the pulse can be determined by varying the (VARIABLENAME) parameter. The frequency of the signal can be determined by varying the (VARIABLENAME) parameter.
